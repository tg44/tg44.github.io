title: Hello World
---

First post! So far so good. I needed to start somewhere.

This will be a techy blog, mostly covered with topics that are not work-related for me. (So not really fit to the blog of my company.) If you want to read about scala/backend stuff from me go to [Wanari-leaks](https://leaks.wanari.com)!

In the future I will write about Jekyll (because it was a mess to start this page), and my adventure in the world of IoT and 3D printing.
